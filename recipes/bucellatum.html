  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p><em>Bucellatum</em> was a Roman hardtack biscuit eaten by Roman soliders. It is created by mixing flour, salt, and water.
    Hardtack, as the name suggests, is very hard, but was a sustainable and portable source of nutrition for roman soldiers.

  <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
  <ul>
   <li>2 3/4 cups wholewheat flour</li>
   <li>1/3 cup water</li>
   <li>1 tsp salt</li>
   <li>2 tsp butter</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
      <li>Mix flour, salt and butter. Then add water, whisking in the process to create a whipped dough
        (the biscuit must be very dry finally)</li>
      <li>Roll out the dough and squeeze round (sources say Roman rusks were round).</li>
      <li>Make holes in the dough allowing air to come in and out of moisture.</li>
      <li>Place the cakes on a tray and place in the oven preheated to 250&#8451.</li>
      <li>Bake rusks for 2.5 hours, shifting them.</li>
      <li>Leave the cakes in the oven for a few hours to cool. If the rusks are not completely dry,
         bake until the expected result.</li>
