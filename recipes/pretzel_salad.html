  <h1>Mandarin Orange Pretzel Salad</h1>
  <p>This is a really pretty dish that can be served as a side dish or dessert.
     This is a variation of the standard “Strawberry Pretzel Salad”. 
     Yes, you can use this baseline recipe for other fruits such as strawberries 
     (use red raspberry Jell-O), pineapple (use pineapple Jell-O), blueberries 
     (use blueberry Jell-O), or other.

   <li>3/4 cups - 1 cup butter melted</li>
   <li>2-3 Tbsp Granulated Sugar</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><strong>Filling:</strong></h3>
  <ul>
   <li>1x 8oz. package cream cheese</li>
   <li>1/2 cup powdered sugar</li>
   <li>1x (8 oz.) cont. Cool Whip non-dairy whipped topping</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><strong>Topping:</strong></h3>
  <ul>
   <li>1x (6 oz.) box orange Jell-O</li>
   <li>2x cups boiling water</li>
   <li>3x (11 oz.) cans mandarin oranges drained</li>
   <li>Whipped cream for serving (optional)</li>
  </ul>
  <h3><strong>Instructions:</strong></h3>
  <ol>
   <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Place pretzels in a 1-gallon size re-sealable bag and crush
with a rolling pin.</li>
   <li><strong>Crust:</strong>In a medium bowl, combine crushed pretzels, melted butter and 3 tablespoons
       sugar. Stir together until well blended. Press the pretzel mixture evenly into a 9 x 
       13-inch baking dish and bake for 7 minutes. Allow crust to cool completely before adding the other layers.</li>
   <li><strong>Filling:</strong>In a large bowl, beat softened cream cheese and 1 cup sugar together until
       smooth. Fold in Cool Whip. Dollop filling over the pretzel crust then spread evenly with an off-set spatula 
       (be sure to seal the cream cheese layer against the sides of the dish so that the Jell-O
        mixture will not be able to leak through when added).</li>
   <li><strong>Topping:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together orange Jell-O and boiling water until the
       Jell-O is completely dissolved. Set aside to cool slightly (about 10-15 minutes). Gently stir in
       mandarin oranges. Pour the Jell-O/Mandarin orange mixture over the cream filling, spread
       evenly.</li>
   <li>Place in the refrigerator and allow Jell-O to set up completely. Cut into squares; serve
       with a dollop of whipped cream!</li>
  </ol>
